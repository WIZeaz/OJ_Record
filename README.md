# OJ_Record
## What is this repo use for?
This is a repo used to record and share my accepted code of problems of different Online Judge. You can review the accepted code here when you struck at some problems. You are welcome to issue the bugs in my programs, I am very appreciated about that.

## Rule of Filename
The filename are composited by letters and numbers. letters indicate the OJ and numbers mean problem number. e.g. POJ1001 mean the problem number is 1001 and come from Peking University Online Judge.
